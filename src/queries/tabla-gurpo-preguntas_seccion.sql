(2, 3, NULL, 'seccion2-parte3-grupo1-historia ------- The last great race on earth In the late 19th century, gold was found in Alaska, drawing many to the region with dreams of wealth. This led to rapid growth in the area, including the establishment of Iditarod, which was named for its remote location and became Alaska’s largest city in 1909. During the summer, essential supplies reached these burgeoning towns by boat. However, the harsh winter months froze the rivers and oceans, cutting off access.By 1910, a winter route was established for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothing to the miners. This path became known as the Iditarod Trail. Traveling across Alaska on this trail took approximately three weeks, with stops at roadhouses for the mushers and their dogs to rest and refuel.The use of the trail continued into the 1920s until airplanes and other modern technologies began to replace the dog sled teams as primary transport methods. Yet, the sled dogs had a significant moment in 1925 during a diphtheria outbreak in Nome. The nearest available medicine was in Anchorage, over 1,000 kilometers away. With severe doubts about the reliability of planes in extreme cold, and the best pilot unavailable, it was decided to use dog sleds for the emergency delivery.Twenty teams relayed the medicine along the Iditarod Trail in just six days. Norwegian Leonhard Seppala and his dog Togo bravely led the first 400 kilometers through perilous conditions. The final stretch was completed by Gunnar Kaasen and his lead dog, Balto, who navigated critical moments, including preventing the team from falling through ice. Their success stopped the epidemic, and Balto emerged as a celebrated hero.Today, the Iditarod dog sled race commemorates this historic relay, spanning from Anchorage to Nome. It honors the courage shown in 1925 and is revered as “The Last Great Race on Earth.”'),

(2, 3, NULL, 'seccion2-parte3-grupo3-historia ------- In the future, cars will likely undergo significant changes, making them more efficient and sustainable. One of the most notable advancements will be the widespread adoption of electric and autonomous vehicles. Electric cars are already becoming more popular due to their lower environmental impact, and in the future, they will have longer battery life and shorter charging times. Autonomous, or self-driving, cars will also become more common. They will be equipped with advanced sensors and artificial intelligence, enabling them to navigate roads safely without human intervention. This will not only reduce traffic accidents but also provide more free time for passengers, who will be able to engage in activities like reading or working while traveling.In addition to these technological improvements, future cars will also focus on connectivity. Vehicles will be able to communicate with each other and with traffic infrastructure, such as traffic lights and road signs, to optimize driving conditions and reduce congestion. Moreover, cars will offer enhanced comfort and entertainment options, such as personalized climate control and interactive displays.Despite these promising developments, challenges remain. The transition to electric and autonomous vehicles will require significant changes in infrastructure, such as charging stations and updated traffic regulations. Furthermore, there are concerns about data privacy and the potential for hacking, as more vehicles become connected to the internet. However, if these issues are addressed, future cars could revolutionize the way we travel.'),

(2, 3, NULL, 'seccion2-parte3-grupo5-historia ------- The nature of work has changed dramatically throughout history, reflecting broader shifts in society. In ancient times, work was primarily based on agriculture. People lived in small communities and relied on farming to survive. The invention of basic tools and the domestication of animals made agricultural work more efficient, but it was still physically demanding and time-consuming. As societies developed, so did the nature of work. During the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a major shift from agriculture to manufacturing. Factories were established, and people moved to cities to work in them. This period saw the rise of new technologies, such as the steam engine and machinery, which greatly increased productivity. However, factory work was often monotonous and dangerous, with long hours and poor working conditions. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rise of technology and globalization has transformed work once again. The development of computers and the internet has led to the growth of service industries and remote work. Many jobs today involve working with information and technology rather than physical labor. Flexible work arrangements, like telecommuting and freelancing, have also become more common. Overall, the evolution of work has been shaped by technological advancements and societal changes. While work in the past was more physically demanding, modern work often requires different skills, such as problem-solving and digital literacy.'),
